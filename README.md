## Hi there 👋

# 👋 Hi, I'm Evrard Fankam

🔧 **Systems Platform Engineer II @ Mastercard | Aspiring Azure Cloud Engineer | Security+ Certified**

I'm a Systems Platform Engineer with 3 years of experience in infrastructure engineering, currently working at Mastercard. Over the past few years, I’ve developed a deep interest in cloud technologies—especially Microsoft Azure—after gaining hands-on exposure to hybrid and cloud-based solutions in my role.

I’m actively pursuing the **Microsoft Certified: Azure Administrator Associate (AZ-104)** certification to build a solid foundation in cloud administration and architecture. I’m also **CompTIA Security+ certified**, and have a growing interest in cloud security and infrastructure-as-code practices.

## 💻 Cloud Journey & Projects

To strengthen my skills and document my learning, I’ve started working on a series of hands-on Azure projects. These projects are designed to evolve in phases—starting with fundamental tasks like deploying virtual networks and VMs, and gradually incorporating more advanced components like load balancers, Azure AD, monitoring tools, and automation.

Each phase is a reflection of my progress, and I welcome feedback from others in the community.

## 🎯 Goals
- Build real-world cloud infrastructure projects in Azure
- Explore cloud security, monitoring, and automation tools
- Network and collaborate with other cloud and IT professionals
- Transition into a full-time **Azure Cloud Engineer** or **Cloud Security Engineer** role

## 🛠️ Tech & Tools
- **Cloud:** Azure, Azure CLI, Azure Resource Manager (ARM)
- **Infrastructure:** Linux (RHEL, Ubuntu), Windows Server, Bash, PowerShell
- **Security:** Security+, Azure Identity & Access Management (IAM)
- **Tools:** GitHub, Terraform (learning), Azure Monitor, Log Analytics

## 🤝 Let’s Connect
If you're a fellow cloud enthusiast, security professional, or just passionate about infrastructure—I'd love to connect, collaborate, and learn together. Feel free to explore my projects and reach out!
